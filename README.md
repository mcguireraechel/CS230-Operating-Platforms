The client, The Gaming room wanted to develop a web-based game that would serve multiple platforms. By taking on the role of a Technology Consultant I introduced the client to different approaches that would allow them to expand their game to multiple operating systems. Then I explained the integration of the game into a distributed environment. Finally, i made recommendations to the client based on different operating systems architectures. 

The part I felt like I did well in this documentation was describing the UML diagram by explaining how the classes related to each other. The UML diagram also helped a lot while developing the code because it gave the code structure before building it. The use of Singleton design pattern also helped a lot in order for there to be multiple instances of the same game.

if I were to revisit this document, I would revisit the overall recommendation’s part at the bottom. Some of my answers were too brief.

In consideration to the user’s needs, i recommended an operating system that was widely available and cost effective for both the client and user. Additionally, i brought security considerations for the client so that users and the client alike would be able to securely use the software.

The UML diagram and Singleton design technique helped tremendously in designing the software. UML provided organization and singleton allowed for each user to have one instance of the game. These techniques will be used in the future for organization
